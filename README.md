# CS-305

The client was artemis financial. They were working on a web application that makes secure financial communications. The issue that the company wanted me to address was the security of the data communications. More specifically, they wanted a checksum verification implemented to verify the data being communicated in a secure way.

I think that a did well in coding the neccessary code for the checksum verification and creating the RESTful route to use the server with it. I believe I also did well in finding the vulnerabilities in the code and fixing them until the dependency check came up with no vulnerabilities. It is important to code securely to prevent any sort of data loss or data theft due to less secure coding methods. Software security adds a lot to a company's overall well being because it keeps all of its work and information secured so that there is much less of a chance of a malicious party causing any damage or setback to a company's work, reputation, or client base.

The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment to me was creating the certificate and refactoring the code in order for the server to be HTTPS instead of HTTP. It definetely took the most time out of all of the steps for me, so I would consider it the hardest part for me.

I increased layers of security by thinking about the areas of security that we were taught about and seeing how I could implement those concepts to help develop and further the security of the code. In the future I would use the areas of vulnerability flowchart that I was given in order to properly assess which techniques to use to increase the code's security.

In order to make sure that my code was functional, I made sure to test that it fully ran without any errors or terminations showing up. I also made sure to see if the data showed up correctly in the HTTPS page. After refactoring the code, I made sure to test if any more vulnerabilities were created by both running another dependency check and making sure no vulnerabilities showed up, and checking the code manually to see if any were there.

Some resources that I used to help me work were of course, the Eclipse IDE in order to write the code. I also used lots of different resources provided to me in the modules, like the vulnerability flowchart, and the Oracle list of algorithm ciphers. While I was working, I also made sure to use the industry standard best practices in my work.

From this assignment, I could potentially show future employers that I have some experience with Java and the Ecplipse IDE. I could also show that I can run a secure server using HTTPS and requiring a valid certificate to access. I would also be able to show that I have knowledge of algorithm ciphers and can utilize hash functions to make a checksum for data verification.
